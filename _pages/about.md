Hi! I'm a student studying Computer Science and Mathematics at UC Berkeley. I'm generally interested in the Mechanistic Interpretability of LLMs, spending my days exploring rabbit holes in a semi-rigorous manner. In my blog, I like to write about whatever piques my curiosity.

This summer, I'm researching LLM reasoning and testing strategies in parallelization, heterogeneous MoE, and complexity-informed routing. Fortunate to be advised by Vasu Sharma (FAIR) and Prof. Sanjit Seshia (Berkeley) in SLICE Lab.

At school, I enjoy teaching CS 70 Discrete Math and Probability Theory. Previously, I also cofounded Berkeley's largest AI startup incubator, AI Entrepreneurs at Berkeley. In just 2 years, our startups raised $15M+ in venture capital from firms like PearVC and Seqouia, partnering with leading names like Gradescope and Y Combinator.

I'm a fan of Suisei, Genshin Impact, Animenz, and a big fan of LeBron.

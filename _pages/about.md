Hi! I'm a student studying Computer Science and Mathematics at Berkeley. I'm generally interested in Multimodal Understanding and Mechanistic Interpretability, spending my days exploring rabbit holes in a somewhat-rigorous manner. In my blog, I like to write about whatever piques my curiosity.

At school, I enjoy teaching Discrete Math and Probability Theory.

I'm currently researching LLM efficiency and learning strategies in parallelization, early exit, MoE, and complexity metrics, advised by Vasu Sharma (Meta) and Sanjit Seshia (Berkeley).

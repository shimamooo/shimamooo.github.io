Hi! I'm a student studying Computer Science and Mathematics at Berkeley. I'm broadly interested in Multimodal Understanding and Mechanistic Interpretability, spending my days exploring rabbit holes in a somewhat-rigorous manner. In my blog, I like to write about whatever piques my curiosity.

At school, I enjoy teaching and am part of course staff for Discrete Math and Probability Theory.

I'm currently wrapping up research in LLM efficiency and learning strategies in parallelization, early exit, MoE, and complexity metrics.

I've gone through the ![Arena AI Safety coursework](https://arena-chapter1-transformer-interp.streamlit.app/), a course covering the basics of Mechanistic Interpretability for LLMs and practical skills such as Wandb, TransformerLens, OpenAI Gymnasium, PPO, and RLHF. I also have strong knowledge of Transformers and implemented it from scratch. I'm currently looking to contribute to a research group for the last two years of my undergrad.

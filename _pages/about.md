Hi! I'm a student studying Computer Science and Mathematics at Berkeley. I'm broadly interested in Multimodal Understanding and Mechanistic Interpretability, spending my days exploring rabbit holes in a somewhat-rigorous manner. In my blog, I like to write about whatever piques my curiosity.

At school, I enjoy teaching and am part of course staff for Discrete Math and Probability Theory.

I'm currently doing research in LLM efficiency and learning strategies in parallelization, early exit, MoE, and complexity metrics.
